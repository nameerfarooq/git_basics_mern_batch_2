    <h1><b><i>HTML Summary</i></b></h1>
    <h2>FORMS</h2>
    <p>
        HTML forms are an essential part of web development because they allow websites to collect user input and send it to the server for processing. Forms are commonly used in login systems, registration, surveys, search bars, and order placements. They support different input types such as text fields, email fields, passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus, which make user interaction more flexible. A form can send data using two main methods: GET, which is visible in the URL and used for simple searches, and POST, which is more secure and used for sensitive information like passwords and payments. Forms also include attributes like required fields, placeholders, and validation features to improve usability and ensure correct data entry. With modern HTML5, validation such as email or number checks can be done without JavaScript, making forms more powerful and user-friendly. Overall, HTML forms act as the bridge between the user and the server, making them a vital tool for building interactive and dynamic websites.

    <h2>FLEX-BOX</h2>
    <p>
        CSS Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a modern layout system that makes it easier to design responsive and dynamic web pages. Unlike traditional layouts that relied heavily on floats or tables, Flexbox is designed to align and distribute space among items inside a container efficiently. It allows developers to control the direction of items (row or column), alignment (center, start, or end), and spacing between them with simple properties. One of its strongest features is the ability to adapt to different screen sizes without breaking the layout, making it ideal for responsive design. Flexbox also supports ordering elements without changing the HTML structure, giving developers greater flexibility in design. Its ability to handle both horizontal and vertical alignment easily has made it one of the most widely used tools in modern CSS. Overall, Flexbox simplifies layout creation and ensures consistency across devices, which saves both time and effort in web development.
