    <h2>SUMMARY: <br> WHAT IS POSITIONING?</h2>
    <p>CSS positioning allows you to control the layout of HTML elements. There are five types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. Static is the default position, where elements follow the normal document flow. Relative positioning allows you to offset an element from its normal position using properties like top and left. Absolute positioning removes an element from the normal flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Fixed positioning keeps an element in place relative to the viewport, even during scrolling. Sticky positioning makes an element stick to a specific position within its parent element based on scroll position. By combining these positioning types with properties like z-index, you can create complex layouts and overlapping elements, giving you fine-grained control over your web page's design.</p>
    <p>There are 5 types of positioning:</p>
    <li><b> Static:</b> This is the default positioning value. Elements with position: static are positioned according to the normal document flow.</li>
    <li><b>Relative:</b> Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position. You can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to offset the element from its normal position.</li>
    <li><b>Absolute:</b> Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor (instead of their normal position). If no ancestor is positioned, it will be positioned relative to the body element.</li>
    <li><b>Fixed:</b> Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). They will remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.</li>
    <li><b>Sticky:</b> Elements with position: sticky are positioned based on the user's scroll position. They will stick to a specific position within their parent element.
    <p> <b>When working with positioning, you'll often use the following properties:</p></b>
    <b> -top, right, bottom, and left: </b> These properties specify the offset of an element from its reference point (depending on the positioning type). <br>
    <b> -z-index:</b> This property specifies the stacking order of elements that overlap. Elements with a higher z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower value.

    <li> Creating dropdown menus or tooltips with position: absolutec <br>
    <li> Fixing a navigation bar to the top of the page with position: fixed<br>
    <li> Creating a sticky footer that stays at the bottom of the page with position: sticky<br>
    <li> Overlapping elements, such as text on top of an image, with position: absolute and z-index<br>
